# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solutions for the [_Advent of Code 2019_](https://adventofcode.com/2019) Challenge.

It is my goal to solve these challenges in as many different programming languages as possible to not write Rust all the time and rediscover my love or disgust for other languages. I will see how far I can get before the languages repeat.

Input files are kept in the `input/` folder following the scheme `day_X.txt` and are not committed here (especially since every player gets individual input files).

## Lessons Learned

- Bash sucks. Hard. Doing math things is incredibly painful and functions with their `return` statement are weird. Just don't do that.
